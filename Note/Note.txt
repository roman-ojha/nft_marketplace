*) What are NFTs?
    -> non-fungible token, means that it can't be interchanged for another with in the same collection
    -> Like ETH, Bitcoin, Dolor are interchangeable but NFTs can't
    -> Each NFTs values different
    -> NFTs smart contract also keep track of the owners of each NFTs
    -> there are special function on the contract that allow us to transfer NFTs to new addresses

*) About Project:
    -> so we will going to write Marketplace contract that interact with these function on nft contract to allow users to buy and sell NFTs
    -> When user want to list their NFTs for sale they will call the function that will transfer there NFTs to the marketplace 
    -> and the marketplace will keep tract of the seller of the NFTs and the price they want to sell it at
    -> User can buy and listed NFTs by calling a function that transfers the amount of ether the nft was priced at from the buyer to the seller then transfer the NFTs from the marketplace to the buyer
    -> also our NFTs contract will have mint function that will allow sellers to create new NFTs and then list them on the marketplace

*) Dependencies that we need:
    -> NodeJS
    -> Hardhat
        -> yarn add -D hardhat@2.8.3 (download this specific version) 
    -> Starter for this project: https://github.com/dappuniversity/starter_kit_2
    -> react-router-dom
    -> IPFS HTTP client
        -> (to upload content of NTFs to IPFS)
        -> yarn add ipfs-http-client@56.0.1
    -> OpenZeppelin
        -> (it is a contract library that contain secure pre made contract that we can import into the projects when writing the new contract)
        -> (we will going to use this to import ERC-721 NFTs standard)
        -> https://www.openzeppelin.com/
        -> yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts@4.5.0
