*) What are NFTs?
    -> non-fungible token, means that it can't be interchanged for another with in the same collection
    -> Like ETH, Bitcoin, Dolor are interchangeable but NFTs can't
    -> Each NFTs values different
    -> NFTs smart contract also keep track of the owners of each NFTs
    -> there are special function on the contract that allow us to transfer NFTs to new addresses

*) About Project:
    -> so we will going to write Marketplace contract that interact with these function on nft contract to allow users to buy and sell NFTs
    -> When user want to list their NFTs for sale they will call the function that will transfer there NFTs to the marketplace 
    -> and the marketplace will keep tract of the seller of the NFTs and the price they want to sell it at
    -> User can buy and listed NFTs by calling a function that transfers the amount of ether the nft was priced at from the buyer to the seller then transfer the NFTs from the marketplace to the buyer
    -> also our NFTs contract will have mint function that will allow sellers to create new NFTs and then list them on the marketplace
    -> Contract on this project:
        1. NFT
        2. Marketplace

*) Dependencies that we need:
    -> NodeJS
    -> Hardhat
        -> yarn add -D hardhat@2.8.3 (download this specific version) 
    -> Starter for this project: https://github.com/dappuniversity/starter_kit_2
    -> react-router-dom
    -> Bootstrap to style client
    -> IPFS HTTP client
        -> (to upload content of NTFs to IPFS)
        -> yarn add ipfs-http-client@56.0.1
    -> OpenZeppelin
        -> (it is a contract library that contain secure pre made contract that we can import into the projects when writing the new contract)
        -> (we will going to use this to import ERC-721 NFTs standard)
        -> https://www.openzeppelin.com/
        -> yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts@4.5.0


*) Project Structure:
    -> src/
        -> backend/
            -> (will contain all of the smart contract, test for the contract)
            -> scripts/deploy.js (to deploy smart contract to local environment blockchain)
        -> frontend/
            -> (contain client side application)

*) ERC-721:
    -> https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721
    -> ERC721 Standard define the set of all function that a NFTs contract should have in minimum
    -> This standard is design so that any NFT contract is compatible to any Dapps and wallets
    -> ERC-721 Function / Api
    -> https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721
    -> this contract have a lot of function we don't need a lot of function for this project but that function that we have to understand for this project are:
        1) transferFrom(from, to, tokenId)
            -> this function will transfer NFTs(tokenId) from one account to another
        2) approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)
            -> Give permission to transfer tokenId token to another account. 
            -> whenever we transfer NFTs to a marketplace the user have to call this 'approve' function first
